# Project Title
Wine Flavor Profile Prediction Tool (need to find a name)

## Overview

**Wine Flavor Profile Prediction Tool** is a web application designed to predict the flavor profile of a wine based on its characteristics. Users can input details such as grape variety, region, and winemaking techniques, and the app will use machine learning models trained on wine data to generate a flavor profile prediction.


### Problem

Wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs often seek to understand the flavor profile of a wine before purchasing or tasting it. However, predicting the flavor profile based on various wine characteristics can be challenging. This app addresses this pain point by providing a tool that predicts the flavor profile based on the input characteristics, helping users make informed decisions and enhancing their wine experience.

### User Profile

- Wine enthusiasts and connoisseurs
- Sommeliers and wine professionals
- Wine retailers and distributors

### Features

- Input selections
- Prediction result


## Implementation

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: 
- Libraries: Axios for API calls

### APIs

- Wine data API (for wine recommendations, prices, pairing (if included / this will be nice to have))
- Open AI (for retrieving wine characteristics)

### Sitemap

- **Home Page:** Introduction and description of the tool
- **Input Page:** Form for users to input wine characteristics
- **Prediction Result Page:** Display predicted flavor profile with visualizations

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

**Sprint 1:**
- Set up project structure and environment
- Implement basic frontend components (Home Page, Input Page)
- Set up backend with basic endpoints

**Sprint2:** 
- Integrate AI model for prediction
- Implement prediction result page
- Create basic visualizations for flavor profile

## Nice-to-haves

- *User Profiles:*  Allow users to create and manage profiles, save predictions, and view history
- *Social Sharing:* Enable users to share their predictions on social media
- *Recommendation System:* Suggest similar wines based on the predicted flavor profile
